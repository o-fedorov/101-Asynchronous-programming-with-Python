Specifically, *all* functionality related to the asynchronous environment utilizes \"async/await\" features and syntax--without exception. Moreover, interactions between async and sync code is carefully managed through a small set of simple mechanisms such as events and queues. As a result, Curio is small, fast, and significantly easier to reason about.\n",
