    "1. For simple cases of concurency consider using multithreading.  If you need heavy computations or true parallelism, use multiprocessing approach, or even a distributed application.\n",
    "2. Multitasking and coroutines are good for I/O operations.  Also *multiprocessing applications* can be written in asynchronous style.\n",
    "3. Python does great job hiding implementation details behind `async` and `await` keywords, making them look similar to regular synchronous code.\n",
    "4. Python coroutines do not need `asyncio` to be executed.  `asyncio` is just one of the asynchronous frameworks that are able to run your asyncronous code."
